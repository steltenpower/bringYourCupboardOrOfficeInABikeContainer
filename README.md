# bringYourCupboardOrOfficeInABikeContainer
Just 2 applications of https://www.velove.se/containerisation-last-mile-solution :

2 examples of how this would save time and stress:

1
Decide to go on holiday, and a few minutes later GO!, because:
A cupboard in your house has all essentials ready, and this cupboard is build as a container.
This container fits on your bike, bike-trailer, or that of a transport agency (DHL for example, who uses the Armadillo to move them)
No jamming it into suitcases, jamming those into your car, and then jamming the content into your vacation bungalow's cupboard

2
A bunch of free-lancers all bring their own 'fold-open office-in-container' to a flex working building, a construction site, nice spot in the park, whatever ...
Just attach power (if you don't have solar on top) and go!
